#  Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **customer churn** — i.e. whether a customer will stop using a service — based on historical customer data.  
It is built for practice and demonstrates a full ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.

## Project Overview

| Attribute  | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Task | Customer churn classification/prediction |
| Language | Python |
| Libraries | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn |
| Input | Customer dataset with features like age, contract type, usage stats, etc. |
| Output | Predicted churn status (Yes / No) |

##  How It Works
1. Load the customer dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, feature scaling if needed)  
3. Train a classification model (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, or chosen model)  
4. Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
5. Visualize results (confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance, etc.)
